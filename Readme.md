### Cost Optimization Decisions

To ensure a cost-effective solution without compromising on functionality, all tools used in this DevSecOps project have been integrated into the Jenkins server. This approach avoids the need for additional servers or infrastructure, reducing operational costs.

#### Rationale
- **Centralized Integration**: Running all tools (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, Trivy, TFsec, SonarQube, OWASP ZAP) on the same server minimizes resource utilization and eliminates the cost of multiple servers.
- **Simplified Management**: Centralized integration simplifies maintenance, monitoring, and updates for all tools.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Using the Jenkins server for multi-purpose tasks optimizes the allocated resources, leveraging idle capacity during pipeline executions.

#### Implementation
- All tools are installed and configured on the Jenkins server instance.
- Prometheus and Grafana are set up to run on separate ports to avoid conflicts.
- Tools like Trivy, TFsec, and OWASP ZAP are containerized or run as CLI tools, leveraging Docker where applicable.

### Restarting Jenkins

After installing plugins or making configuration changes, you may need to restart your Jenkins server. You can do this in one of the following ways:

1. **Using the systemctl command** (Linux systems):
   ```bash
   systemctl restart jenkins
    ```
2. **Using the Jenkins UI:**
If you're on the plugin installation page, check the *"Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running"* box at the bottom of the page.
Alternatively, navigate to the following URL in your browser to restart Jenkins:
```bash
http://<public-ip>:8080/restart
```
Replace <public-ip> with your Jenkins server's public IP address.
Ensure Jenkins has fully restarted before proceeding with further tasks.


### Troubleshooting: Updating Jenkins IP Address

If you stop the Jenkins instance and start it again, you may experience slowness when accessing Jenkins or making changes. This happens because the Jenkins IP address changes after restarting the instance.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps to update the latest IP address in Jenkins:

1. Open the Jenkins configuration file:
   ```bash
   vi /var/lib/jenkins/jenkins.model.JenkinsLocationConfiguration.xml
   ```
2. Update the `Jenkins URL` field with the new public IP address of the instance.

3. Save the changes and restart Jenkins:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart jenkins
   ```

## Bringing Visibility to Trivy & TFsec: Security Insights with Prometheus & Grafana

Trivy and TFsec are powerful security scanning tools for containers and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), but they lack a built-in graphical interface for visualizing vulnerabilities. This project bridges that gap by integrating Trivy and TFsec with Prometheus and Grafana, transforming raw security scan data into insightful, real-time dashboards for better monitoring and decision-making. ðŸš€

## Trivy Integration

### Scan Docker Image with Trivy
```sh
trivy image --format json --severity HIGH,CRITICAL <image-name> > trivy-results.json
```

After running this command, a `trivy-results.json` file will be created.

###  Generate Prometheus Metrics from Trivy Results
Create a file `generate-trivy-metrics.js` and add the following content:

```bash
vi generate-trivy-metrics.js
```
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

try {
    console.log('Reading Trivy results...');
    const trivyResults = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('trivy-results.json', 'utf8'));

    console.log('Generating Prometheus metrics...');
    const metrics = [];
    trivyResults.Results.forEach((result) => {
        result.Vulnerabilities.forEach((vuln) => {
            metrics.push(`# HELP trivy_vulnerabilities Trivy vulnerability scan results`);
            metrics.push(`# TYPE trivy_vulnerabilities gauge`);
            metrics.push(`trivy_vulnerabilities{image="${result.Target}",severity="${vuln.Severity}",id="${vuln.VulnerabilityID}"} 1`);
        });
    });

    console.log('Writing metrics to trivy-metrics.prom...');
    fs.writeFileSync('trivy-metrics.prom', metrics.join('\n'));
    console.log('Metrics file trivy-metrics.prom created successfully.');
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error.message);
}
```
Run the script:
```sh
node generate-trivy-metrics.js
```
A `trivy-metrics.prom` file will be created.

Move the file to the `metrics` directory:
```sh
mv trivy-metrics.prom metrics
```

Start a simple HTTP server to expose metrics on **port 8085**:
```sh
python3 -m http.server 8085
```

### Add Trivy to Prometheus Configuration
Edit `prometheus.yaml`:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "trivy"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["<your-server-ip>:8085"]
```
Reload Prometheus to apply changes.

### Visualize Trivy Metrics in Grafana
1. Open Grafana (`http://<your-server-ip>:3000`)
2. Navigate to **Configuration â†’ Data Sources**
3. Add **Prometheus** as a data source with URL `http://localhost:9090`
4. Create a new dashboard:
   - Add a new panel
   - Use PromQL query:
     ```
     trivy_vulnerabilities
     ```
   - Choose a visualization type (Table, Gauge, Time Series, etc.)
   - Save the dashboard
---

## TFsec Integration

###  Run TFsec and Generate JSON Output
```sh
cd /root/DevSecOps-End-to-End-Project/terraform
tfsec . --format=json > tfsec-results.json
```

###  Generate Prometheus Metrics from TFsec Results
Create a file `generate-tfsec-metrics.js` and add the following content:

```bash
vi generate-tfsec-metrics.js
```

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

console.log("Reading TFsec results...");
const tfsecResults = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('tfsec-results.json', 'utf8'));

console.log("Generating Prometheus metrics...");
let metrics = "# HELP tfsec_vulnerabilities TFsec vulnerability scan results\n";
metrics += "# TYPE tfsec_vulnerabilities gauge\n";

tfsecResults.results.forEach(result => {
    metrics += `tfsec_vulnerabilities{severity="${result.severity}",rule_id="${result.rule_id}",description="${result.description.replace(/"/g, '\\"')}"} 1\n`;
});

console.log("Writing metrics to tfsec-metrics.prom...");
fs.writeFileSync('tfsec-metrics.prom', metrics);

console.log("Metrics file tfsec-metrics.prom created successfully.");
```
Run the script:
```sh
node generate-tfsec-metrics.js
```
A `tfsec-metrics.prom` file will be created.

Move the file to the `metrics` directory:
```sh
mv tfsec-metrics.prom metrics
```

Start a simple HTTP server to expose metrics  on **port 8086**:
```sh
python3 -m http.server 8086
```

### Add TFsec to Prometheus Configuration
Edit `prometheus.yaml`:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "tfsec"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["<your-server-ip>:8086"]
```
Reload Prometheus to apply changes.

### Step 4: Visualize TFsec Metrics in Grafana
1. Open Grafana (`http://<your-server-ip>:3000`)
2. Navigate to **Configuration â†’ Data Sources**
3. Add **Prometheus** as a data source with URL `http://localhost:9090`
4. Create a new dashboard:
   - Add a new panel
   - Use PromQL query:
     ```
     tfsec_vulnerabilities
     ```
   - Choose a visualization type (Table, Gauge, Time Series, etc.)
   - Save the dashboard

Now, you can monitor security vulnerabilities detected by Trivy and TFsec in Grafana!

## OpenTelemetry Setup and Configuration
Since we have already installed the OpenTelemetry-related dependencies and updated the `collectorUrl` in `server.js` earlier, let's proceed with downloading the OpenTelemetry Collector.

 ### Download and Set Up OpenTelemetry Collector
The OpenTelemetry Collector processes and exports telemetry data from the application to a desired backend.

#### **Download the Collector**
```bash
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.83.0/otelcol-contrib_0.83.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```
- **Why:** Downloads the OpenTelemetry Collector binary (Contrib version).
- **Result:** A `.tar.gz` file is downloaded.

#### **Extract the File**
```bash
tar -xvf otelcol-contrib_0.83.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

#### Move the Binary to a System-Wide Location
```bash
sudo mv otelcol-contrib /usr/local/bin/otelcol
```
- **Why:** Places the binary in a directory included in your systemâ€™s PATH, so you can run it from anywhere.
- **Result:** The Collector is installed and ready to use.

#### Verify Installation
```bash
otelcol --version
```

![](/Images/otel-version.jpg)
- **Why:** Confirms that the Collector is installed correctly.
- **Result:** Displays the version of the Collector.

---

### Run the OpenTelemetry Collector
Ensure the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file is present in your directory. Run the Collector with the configuration file.
```bash
otelcol --config otel-collector-config.yaml
```

![](/Images/otel-success.jpg)
- **Why:** Starts the Collector with the specified configuration.
  - Receives traces from your application.
  - Processes and exports traces to the desired backend (e.g., logging, Jaeger).
- **Result:** The Collector is running and ready to process telemetry data.

Check the Collector logs to confirm traces are being received:
```
INFO    TracesExporter  {"kind": "exporter", "data_type": "traces", "resource spans": 1, "spans": 1}
```
### Metrics Endpoint

The OpenTelemetry Collector exposes its internal metrics at the /metrics endpoint. These metrics are in Prometheus format and provide insights into the Collector's performance and health.

Access the metrics at:
```bash
http://your-public-ip:8888/metrics
```
---
![](/Images/otel-metrics.jpg)

---

### 8. Enhance Tracing in the Application (*This step is already included in server.js*)
Add custom spans to improve the observability of specific routes.

#### **Edit `server.js` to Add Custom Spans**
```bash
vi /root/otel-ecommerce-integration/src/server.js
```
Add the following code to create a custom span for the `/custom` route:
```javascript
app.get('/custom', (req, res) => {
    const span = tracer.startSpan('Custom Route Span');
    res.send('This is a custom route');
    span.end();
});
```
- **Why:** Custom spans provide detailed observability for specific operations.
- **Result:** Requests to `/custom` will generate a new span named `Custom Route Span`.

#### **Restart the Application**
```bash
node server.js
```
- **Why:** Applies the changes to the server.
- **Result:** The application restarts with the new custom span functionality.

#### **Test the Custom Route**
Visit the custom route in your browser or using `curl`:
```bash
http://<your-server-ip>:3000/custom
```
---

![](/Images/otel-custom-metrics.jpg)

---
- **Why:** Generates traffic to test the new custom span.
- **Result:** A span is created for the `/custom` route and sent to the Collector.

---

### **9. Verify Traces**
Check the OpenTelemetry Collector logs to confirm that the custom span is being collected:
```bash
INFO    TracesExporter  {"kind": "exporter", "data_type": "traces", "resource spans": 1, "spans": 1}
```

---

## Conclusion:

This setup ensures a complete CI/CD pipeline with integrated security tools for DevSecOps practices. Modify and scale as needed for specific project requirements.
